# Obstacle Avoidance Robot with 2D Mapping 🤖🚗

This project implements an obstacle avoidance system using ROS2 🤖, Python 🐍, and JavaScript, designed for a omnidirectional robot controlled via a web interface. 
The system features real-time 2D mapping 📍 powered by LiDAR data, allowing users to visualize the environment directly from the interface.

## 💡 Highlights:
- Platform: Developed on an NVIDIA Jetson board ⚡ for efficient processing.
- Obstacle Avoidance 🚧: Achieved using a potential field method 🌌, combining repulsive forces (from obstacles) and attractive forces (toward the target).
